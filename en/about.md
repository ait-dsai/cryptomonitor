		  	Context
		  </h2>
      Money flows in the always relevant cryptocurrency Bitcoin can nowadays be traced relatively well. However, the need for new forensic methods is already foreseeable due to the advancing technical development: virtual financial assets, so-called crypto-assets, and financial products like tokens and <b>smart contracts</b> as well as <b>off-chain</b> payment channels are increasingly used. They will soon make current blockchain forensic tools obsolete.

          The expected outcomes of the project are: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              a legal assessment of the developed methods and regulatory recommendations with regard to tokens and payment channels
            </li>
            <li>
              new forensic methods for the analysis of generic crypto-assets that will be integrated as program modules into existing tools (e.g. BlockSci, GraphSense)
            </li>
            <li>
              a systematic analysis and risk assessment of crypto-assets
            </li>
            <li>
              formats for a harmonized exchange of data between involved partners
            </li>
            <li>
              a coordinated cryptocurrency forensics curriculum as a qualification measure for investigators.
